;;  Layout Selection Default file
;;  for EPiKaL Portable Keyboard Layout (EPKL) by Øystein "DreymaR" Bech-Aase (2015-), based on PKL by Máté Farkas (2008-2010).
;;  For more info, see the README files and the Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks: https://dreymar.colemak.org – select Windows.
;
;;  - For Layout choice and settings, use the EPKL_Layouts .ini file(s). For program settings, use EPKL_Settings.
;;  - For each of these, there is a Default file and optionally an Override file, the settings in which take precedence.
;;  - For Extend layer mappings (navigation/editing etc), see the _eD_Extend.ini file. Set the modifier key in any active LayStack file.
;;  - In the Files folder there are Compose, DeadKeys, Extend, PwrStrings and Remap special files with different types of entries.
;;  ================================================================================================================================================
;
;;  The EPKL Settings GUI:
;;  - You can set the active layout with a handy EPKL Settings window from the EPKL Layout/Settings menu.
;;  - Any changes you submit from that window will be written to your Override (or layout) file, thus taking precedence.
;;  - If you wish, you can then edit the entries manually in the Override file. You may also Reset them with a button.
;;  - The Settings GUI can also change general settings, special keys (Extend and Compose) and individual key mappings.
;
;;  The EPKL Layouts Default file:
;;  - Any setting in this file may be overridden by a EPKL_Layouts_Override.ini, and/or the active (Base)layout files.
;;  - Choose a layout that fits your board (ISO/ANSI) and ergo mod preferences. CAWS=CurlAWideSym is great!    d( ^◇^)b
;;  - The main layout file is "Layouts\<LayoutMainFolder>\Layout.ini"; the folder can be any subpath of Layouts\.
;;  - You can use multiple layouts and give them human-readable names like this:
;;      layout = LayoutFolder1:DisplayedName1,LayoutFolder2:DisplayedName2
;;  - Remove `;` before `layout = ` on one line only in the [pkl] section and comment out the current - or make your own!
;;  - Only the first `[pkl]` section is used. Uncomment (delete `;` in front of) an earlier section to override a later one.
;;  - Define layouts directly by folder name(s), or use the "universal" shorthand form below (if that layout variant exists)
;
;;  Shorthand notation:
;;  - Below I've used a compact layout setup notation for EPKL, configurable for ANSI/ISO keyboards and ergonomic mods
;;    - Instead of the lines below, you may use the Layout/Settings... menu which will produce an Override line right under [pkl].
;;    - If such lines exist in a Layouts_Override file, delete or put semicolons in front of them to use entries further down.
;;    - To use LayType, KbdType, Curl/ErgoMod etc shorthand, refer to them as @# on the layout line, as explained below.
;;    - You can use full layout folder paths starting from `Layouts` instead of shorthand notation; these are equivalent.
;;    - My main layout types are:
;;      - [eD] with full Shift/AltGr character mappings, and
;;      - VK/SC or 'VirtualKey'/'ScanCode' which only moves keys around (Shift/AltGr mappings are kept as in the OS layout)
;
;;  Shorthand specification:
;;  - LayMain (@L) values: Any main layouts found in the Layouts folder. Examples: Colemak, Tarmak, Dvorak, QWERTY....
;;      - 3LA (@3) is shorthand for the three-letter abbreviation associated with each main layout: Cmk, Tmk, QWE, Dvk etc.
;;      - This may be found in a shortLays entry in the Tables file, or LayMain may declare it as 'LayName/3LA'.
;;      - If left unspecified, the 3LA will simply be the first three letters of LayMain (=LayName).
;;  - LayPath (@P) values: Some layouts like Colemak and Tarmak have variant subfolders. Include these in LayPath as shown.
;;      - The path starts with the LayName (@L) and if subfolders are used they tend to use the 3LA after '\'.
;;      - The layout folders themselves also have to start with the 3LA; this is added automatically (<LayPath>\@3).
;;  - LayType (@T) values: eD (edition DreymaR w/ AltGr & dead keys), VK or SC (just move keys around)
;;  - LayVari (@V) values: -- (defaults to US-type), Locale code (usually 2-letter ISO ALPHA-2 country codes like in XKB)
;;      - Premade locales (mostly CurlAWide): BaHrRsSi, BeCaFr, BrPt, Cz, De, DkNo, EsLat, FiSe, It, Nl, Pl, Ru/Bg...
;;      - For variants like ItAlt, use 'Colemak-It' for @L and 'Alt' for @V. Or use the Layout/Settings menu instead?
;;      - For the Tarmak layouts, the Layout Variant specifies the Tarmak step number as QWE then Tm1-Tm5. See below.
;;  - KbdType (@K) values: ANS/ISO for ANSI or ISO (w/ a VK_102 key left of Z). JIS is not implemented yet, sorry! ᏊᵕꈊᵕᏊ
;;  - CurlMod (@C) values: Curl (Colemak-DH), or -- (none). Primarily for Cmk/Tmk layouts with Angle(-Wide) mods.
;;  - HardMod (@H) values: --, Angle, AWide, AWing (AWing is ANSI only) "hard" layout invariant geometric ergonomic mods.
;;  - OthrMod (@O) values: --, Any other mods available as a suffix, such as DreymaR's Syms (Symbol key mod)
;;  
;;  - LayPath (@P) is shorthand for LayName\Subfolder when there are variant subfolders under LayName (LayMain). Otherwise @L.
;;  - LayDesc (@Ʃ) is shorthand for the Path/Type/Variant layout ensemble (@P-@T@V).
;;  - ErgoMod (@E) is shorthand for the Curl/Hard/Other ergomods ensemble (@C@H@O).
;;      - ErgoMod examples: CurlMod/HardMod/OthrMod = --/--/-- gives no ergo mods; Colemak w/ Curl/AWide/Sym gives Colemak-CAWS.
;;  - @Ʃ_@K@E      is shorthand for @P-@T@V_@K[_@C@H@O], which is a full layout folder definition.
;;  - The above parses to a full layout = `<LayPath>\<3LA>-<LayType>[-<LayVari>]_<KbdType>[_<CurlMod><ErgoMod><OthrMod>]` line.
;;  
;;  These two lines are equivalent, one using abbreviations and the other not for <LayoutFolderPath>:<MenuDescription>:
;;  layout = @Ʃ_@K@E:@L@V(@T) @E  	; With @L=Colemak, @T=eD, @V=De (German), @K=ISO and ergomods Curl/AWide/-- (Cmk-CAW)
;;  layout = Colemak\Cmk-eD-De_ISO_CurlAWide:Colemak-De(eD) CurlAWide  	; This line would disregard all the @# settings.
;;  Note that not all mod combinations are premade for the various locale variants. You can make more yourself.
;

;;  ================================================================================================================================================
;;  Tarmak learning steps: Gradually switch from VirtualKey QWERTY to Colemak. To use, uncomment this section (`;[pkl]` -> `[pkl]`).
;;  - You need to set the right KbdType (ANS/ISO); see the Big Bag and EPKL documentation. Also uncomment the relevant CurlMod/HardMod.
;;  - The Tarmak steps are: Tarmak0(QWERTY), Tarmak1(E), Tarmak2(ET), Tarmak3(ETR), Tarmak4(ETRO) and Tarmak5(Colemak).
;;  - The lines below have all 5 steps. It may be easier for you to make and use a shorter line with only your current step(s).
;;  - For Tarmak with Curl-DH, the first step has 5(6) changed keys. It's possible to first do the non-Curl step before swapping H-M.
;;  - Since Tarmak layouts are in subfolders by ergo mod, make sure that CurlMod and HardMod are set to the right values as seen below.

[dk_CoDeKey_1]
;;  These are mappings used by the @co1 dead key which may be on the shifted state of a CoDeKey but is in itself just a dead key.

;;    - This may be utilized to get different output according to sequence timing, as an advanced technique.
;;
;;  If using the CoDeKey @co0 DK for locale letters, it may be useful to duplicate at least their shifted states on the @co1 DK.

;;  This is a table of KeyLayoutMap (KLM) codes from the _eD_Remap.ini file. You can use QW### or Co### for EPKL Scan Code (SC) and Virtual Key (VK) names.
;;  KLM codes are intuitive and make no difference between ANSI & ISO board types. Examples: QW_E, Co_F, QW_CM, QWSPC. For VK, use vc(=QW) codes.
