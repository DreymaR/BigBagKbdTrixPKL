;
;;  This file provides named string literals callable by layouts with the &<PS> syntax
;;  It usually goes in the ./Files folder and is used by EPKL.exe
;
;;  - SendInput is not fast for long strings. Meanwhile, any released modifiers get stuck!
;;  - To prevent stuck modifiers, strings can be sent by the Windows SendMessage method.
;;  - For multiline strings, Message performed about twice as fast as Input for me.
;;  - For short strings SendMessage may be slower than SendInput, but it's robust.
;;  - The Paste method pastes the string via the clipboard. May not be reliable in all apps.
;;  - Paste seems best for block sending (n or rn): Fast, if the app gets line breaks right.
;;  - Message sending with +Enter line parsing works in most contexts but it's slower.
;;  
;;  PowerString syntax:
;;  - Any name may be used for &<name>. In layouts, I use short names for aesthetic reasons.
;;  - Multiline strings are used as illustrated below
;;      - The string entry is set to <PS> = <Multiline> ##, where ## is the number of lines
;;      - There should also be ## (00-99) numbered lines named <PS>-##
;;      - End-of-line comments (<whitespace>;<comment>) are not stripped for these lines
;;  - Use optionally quoted strings to preserve white space
;;  - EPKL prefix-entry syntax is useable, as with layout state mappings and Extend/Compose/DKs.
;;      - It only works in single-line PowerStrings, though.
;;  - Use [\r \n \t \b] escapes for [`r `n `t `b] (Return, Newline, Tab, Backspace)
;;  - \n is line break, but some apps require \r\n. Can set the line break mode w/ brkMode.
;;      - With the Text send mode, this may not be required anymore.
;;  - There may be a system limit of about 5000 characters per string? I haven't tested.

[pkl]
;;  Line break mode: Send as `n, send as `r`n, or split lines and send Shift+Enter between.
brkMode = +Enter			; +Enter, n, rn
;;  String send mode: SendMessage calls, Clipboard Paste, SendInput w/ linebreaks, Text.
strMode = Text				; Message, Paste, Input, Text

;;  PowerStrings can be used as abbreviations to allow compact layout entries:
Spc     = β{Space}  		; Any 'Spc' or '={Space}' state entries are hardcoded so they can release DeadKeys etc. This one doesn't.
Tab     = β{Tab}
BSp     = β{BackSpace}  	; A β-prefixed mapping is sent "Blind", that is, sensitive to the current modifier state
CBS     = α^{BackSpace} 	; Ctrl+Back deletes the previous word
WBS     = α{BS}^{BS}    	; Ctrl+Back w/ an extra BS  in front, to ensure a word is deleted even with a following space!
