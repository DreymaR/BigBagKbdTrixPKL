Kanata

The Kanata keyboard layout program
----------------------------------
The files in this folder are for the [Kanata multiplatform layout program][Kanata].
<br>

Colemak-eD for Kanata
---------------------
Included are Kanata definitions for my Colemak-eD mappings, for various ergo mod combos and for both ANSI and ISO keyboards.
- What you'll get at this point is Colemak key remappings, without further layer definitions such as `[eD]`.
- The limitations of a key mapper such as Kanata vs state mapping are explained in the main ['Other' folder README][OthrRM].
- The CAWS variant uses the [**C**url**A**ngle**W**ide and **S**ym][BBTerg] ergonomic mods.
- The Angle mod used is the simple ISO-Angle mod for the ISO install, and the most common ANSI-Angle(Z) mod for the ANSI install.
- I cannot add all possible ergo mod and variant combinations as easily as with EPKL; I don't have the energy for that.
- If you wish another variant you could move the keys around in the relevant file.

Technicalities
--------------
- I haven't used Kanata yet, so I'm pretty green on its ins and outs for now. Sorry.
- You'll have to uncomment the variant you want inside the relevant `.cfg` file.
- Do look inside the files, as they're fairly intuitive.
