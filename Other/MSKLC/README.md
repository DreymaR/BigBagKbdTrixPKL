DreymaR's Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks - EPKL
===========================================
<br>

Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, alias MSKLC
----------------------------------------------
In this folder are files that aren't used by the EPKL program but rather MSKLC-related.
- This is the standard Windows way of implementing and installing system keyboard layouts.
- I actually use both a MSKLC layout (see the enclosed [.KLC file][MyCAWS]) and EPKL on my computer.
- This is because EPKL, while very powerful and versatile, doesn't always play well with low-level keyboard things.
	- These include command interpreters such as the WSL Bash one and Windows PowerShell, and many games.
	- EPKL sends state mapped glyphs as Key Down-then-Up events, so repeats will contain Up events which may mess up gaming.
	- To keep things smooth, EPKL can auto-suspend itself whenever these programs are active. See the `EPKL_Settings` file.
<br>

- MSKLC can be installed from [Microsoft's Download Center][MSKLCd]. With it you can look at existing Win layouts and make new ones.
- This is Microsoft's own tool for generating installable layouts. It was made chiefly for creating QWERTY locale variants.
- As such, it's a bit limited in what it can do. Actually, the underlying code can do a lot more but the user interface has limits.
- One such limit is that VK (VirtualKey) codes aren't shown in the GUI. These affect system shortcuts such as `Ctrl+<letter>`.
- For a good guide to basic and advanced MSKLC usage, see [Henri's MSKLC Guide][MSKLCg].
- If you dabble in layout editing with MSKLC, you may have to edit your .klc file directly to get VK codes right.
	- In Henri's guide you'll also learn to do advanced stuff like swapping system keys (e.g., CapsLock-to-Backspace).
	- If you're eager to map CapsLock to Backspace though, please do consider that EPKL's Extend is so very much better!!!

Colemak-CAWS-eD for MSKLC
-------------------------
Included are MSKLC installs for my Colemak-CAWS-eD layout variant.
- What you'll get is Colemak with the [**C**url(DH), **A**ngle**W**ide and **S**ym mods][BBergo], and the [Colemak[eD] AltGr/deadkey layers][BBeDdk] with most mappings.
- The Angle mod used is the simple ISO-Angle mod for the ISO install, and the most common ANSI-Angle(Z) mod for the ANSI install.
- I cannot add all possible ergo mod and variant combinations as easily as with EPKL, since KLC layouts aren't modular in nature.
- If you wish another variant you could move the keys around in the relevant `.klc` file and compile it as described above.
	- If so, I'd recommend changing the SC codes at the start of the mapping lines for moving keys around. Avoid duplicates.

Installing a MSKLC Layout
-------------------------
- To install a layout from a `.klc` file, it must first be compiled using the `Build DLL and Setup Package` menu option in MSKLC.
- To install a compiled layout, run the `setup.exe` program in its folder. Setup will choose the right `.msi` and `.dll` for you.
- The keyboard verify log may well give a lot of warnings about glyphs being defined twice etc; these don't matter.
- If you have the layout already on your system – let's say you've edited it a little – you must **uninstall** it before compiling.
- NOTE: **You have to restart your computer** before you can choose the newly installed layout!
<br>

- Now you can select the new layout from `Language preferences` (in the tray menu if you have the Language Bar active)
- To see the settings for keyboard layouts in Windows 10, go to the `Settings -> Time & Language -> Language` settings screen.
	- To activate the language bar: `Language -> Keyboard [icon] -> Language bar options` (depending on Win version)
	- To see an installed layout: `Language -> <your layout's language, such as English (United States)> -> Options -> Keyboards`.
- To easily switch between active layouts: Hit Win+Space.
<br>

Uninstalling a MSKLC layout
---------------------------
Sometimes a KLC install can go wrong. That can even [mess up your computer][KLCtec], so beware.
- First of all, to activate an install you need to restart your computer. Do that immediately after installing.
- Secondly, system updates have been known to mess things up with KLC layouts. Again, various tech problems have been reported.
- Here's how to uninstall an installed Windows layout in case you should need to do so:
	- First, make sure it isn't added anywhere in the locale settings:
	- Hit the Win key → type `Settings` → select `Time & Language` → `Language` → `English (US)` or whatever it used → `Options`
	- Under `Colemak`-Something, press the `Remove` button. This deactivates the layout but doesn't actually uninstall it.
	- Next, uninstall it as you would any other program:
	- `Settings` → `Apps` & Features → `Colemak`-Something → Press `Uninstall`
- Restart Windows

Technicalities
--------------
- If you have trouble using a `.klc` file from GitHub with MSKLC, make sure it contains [Windows line endings (CRLF)][WinLin].
- Also, the encoding of the file must be `UTF-16LE-BOM`. GitHub's native format is UTF-8 which is different.
- To get a workable file without downloading the whole repo:
	- Right-click and `Save Link As...` from the `Raw` link on the repo page, or the links below.
	- [Link to the raw Cmk-CAWS-eD-ANS.klc file in this repo][CAWSAr]
	- [Link to the raw Cmk-CAWS-eD-ISO.klc file in this repo][CAWSIr]
	- Make sure the line endings and encoding are right.
	- If you get `UTF-8` encoding and Linux endings as is native for GitHub, set them right using the Notepad++ program or something.
- By downloading the repo as a .zip file you should get the right .klc file formats. Earlier this wasn't the case due to wrong attributes.
