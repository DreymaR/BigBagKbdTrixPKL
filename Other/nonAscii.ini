;     i : with SendInput windows message. Maybe this is the best
;     a : With Alt+Numbers on numpad
;     c : Copy the character to the clipboard and paste from it
default = i

; There are two clipboard modes: If Restore mode is not active, sending a
; Unicode character will erase the current clipboard content.
; If Restore mode is active, the clipboard will be restored
; after a short delay (3 sec). This may be slow if the clipboard content is huge!
