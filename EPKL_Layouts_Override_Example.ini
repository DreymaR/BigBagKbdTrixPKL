;;  EPiKaL PortableKeyboardLayout settings file for EPKL by Øystein "DreymaR" Bech-Aase 2015-, from PKL by Máté Farkas.
;;  For more info, see the README files and the Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks: https://dreymar.colemak.org – select Windows.
;;  The old pkl.ini file held both layout choices, general settings and Extend. These are now separate files.
;;  For Layout choice and settings, use the EPKL_Layouts .ini file(s). For program settings, use EPKL_Settings.
;;  For each of these, there is a Default file and optionally an Override file, the settings in which take precedence.
;;  For Extend layer mappings (navigation/editing etc), use the _eD_Extend.ini file. Set the modifier key in your layout.
;;  In the Files folder there are also DeadKeys, Compose and PwrStrings files that contain different types of mappings.
;;  ================================================================================================================================
;
;;  The EPKL Settings GUI:
;;  - You can set the active layout with a handy EPKL Settings window from the EPKL Layout/Settings menu.
;;  - Any changes you submit from that window will be written to your Override (or layout) file, thus taking precedence.
;;  - If you wish, you can then edit the entries manually in the Override file. You may also Reset them with a button.
;;  - The Settings GUI can also change general settings, special keys (Extend and Compose) and individual key mappings.
;
;;  EPKL Layouts Override file info:
;;  - This file takes precedence over EPKL_Layouts_Default.ini if it's present. Rename or delete it to use the Default file only.
;;  - Any setting that's commented out here by prepending its line with a semicolon, will revert to its Default value.
;;  - The first active line under a section such as [pkl] in this file will be used; or failing that, the Default file.
;;  - For more info about the settings below, see the Default file.

;;  Tarmak learning steps: Gradually switch from VirtualKey QWERTY to Colemak. To use, uncomment this section (`;[pkl]` -> `[pkl]`).
;;  - You need to set the right KbdType (ANS/ISO); see the Big Bag and EPKL documentation. Also uncomment the relevant CurlMod/HardMod.
;;  - The Tarmak steps are: Tarmak0(QWERTY), Tarmak1(E), Tarmak2(ET), Tarmak3(ETR), Tarmak4(ETRO) and Tarmak5(Colemak).
;;  - The lines below have all 5 steps. It may be easier for you to make and use a shorter line with only your current step(s).
;;  - For Tarmak with Curl-DH, the first step has 5(6) changed keys. It's possible to first do the non-Curl step before swapping H-M.
;;  - Since Tarmak layouts are in subfolders by ergo mod, make sure that CurlMod and HardMod are set to the right values as seen below.

[dk_Compose_0]
;;  These are mappings for the CoDeKey DK which works when a Compose key doesn't. What you'll want here is probably individual.
;;  I find using the CoDeKey DK-unless-Compose functionality to be powerful, robust and smooth. It uses the @co0 dead key.

[dk_Compose_1]
;;  These are mappings used by the @co1 dead key which may be on the shifted state of a CoDeKey but is in itself just a dead key.
;;  Beware of DKs on shifted states that they may not work quite as expected using Sticky Shift, as it holds down the Shift state.
;;    - This may be utilized to get different output according to sequence timing, as an advanced technique.
;
;;  If using the CoDeKey @co0 DK for locale letters, it may be useful to duplicate at least their shifted states on the @co1 DK.
