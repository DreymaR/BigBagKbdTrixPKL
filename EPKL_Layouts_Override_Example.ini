;;  EPKL settings .ini file for PortableKeyboardLayout by Farkas Máté, EPiKaL edition "DreymaR" by Øystein Bech Gadmar
;;  For more info, see the help files and the Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks: https://dreymar.colemak.org [select Windows].
;;  NOTE: The old pkl.ini file held both layout choices, settings and Extend. These are now separate files.
;;  For Layout choice, use the EPKL_Layouts .ini file(s). For program settings, use EPKL_Settings.
;;  For each of these, there is a Default file and optionally an Override file, the settings in which take precedence.
;;  For Extend layer mappings (navigation/editing/etc), use the _eD_Extend.ini file. Set the modifier key in your layout.
;;  =====================================================================================================================
;
;;  =====================================================================================================================
;;  NOTE: You can also set the active layout with a handy EPKL Settings window from the EPKL Layout/Settings menu.
;;  - Any changes you submit from that window will be written to your Override file, thus taking precedence.
;;  - If you wish, you can then edit the entries manually in the Override file. You may also Reset them in the window.
;;  - The Settings GUI window can change individual key mappings and general settings as well.
;
;;  =====================================================================================================================
;;  EPKL Layout override settings:
;;  - This file takes precedence over EPKL_Layouts_Default.ini if it's present. Rename or delete it to use the normal file.
;;  - Any setting that's commented out here by prepending its line with a semicolon, will revert to its Default value.
;;  - The 'layout = ' line used is the first one encountered under [pkl] in this file, or failing that, the Default file.
;;  - For more info about the settings below, see the Default file.
;

[pkl]
;;  Shorthand notation for layout selections below. You may instead use the full layout folder paths explicitly, and/or the Layout/Settings menu.
;;  NOTE: Some layouts like Colemak and Tarmak have subfolders. Include these in LayMain as shown. For variants like ItAlt, use '-It' for @V in LayMain.
;LayMain = Tarmak\@3-@K@C@H 	; For Tarmak, uncomment this line (remove the semicolon) and one of the Tarmak layout lines, and set your KbdType.
LayMain = Colemak\@3-@T@V 	; @L: Colemak, Tarmak, Dvorak, QWERTY.... Implies and may contain the 3-Letter-Abbreviation, as '@L/@3'.
LayType = eD 				; @T: eD (edition DreymaR AltGr mappings), VK (just moves keys around)
LayVari = -- 				; @V: --, Variant/Locale code. Check in the layout folders which combos exist, or make your own.
KbdType = ISO 				; @K:     ANS (US/ANSI 101/104 key), ISO (Euro/World 102/105 key)
CurlMod = Curl 				; @C: --, Curl/DH mod; usually with an Angle/AWide ergo mod. For the old Curl-DHk variant, see _eD_Remap.ini.
HardMod = AWide 			; @H: --, Angle, AWide, AWing
OthrMod = Sym 				; @O: --, Any other mods available as a suffix, such as DreymaR's Sym

;;  Tarmak learning steps: Gradually switch from VirtualKey QWERTY to Colemak. You need to set LayMain = Tarmak and KbdType etc. above.
;;  - The Tarmak steps are: Tarmak0(QWERTY), Tarmak1(E), Tarmak2(ET), Tarmak3(ETR), Tarmak4(ETRO) and Tarmak5(Colemak).
;;  - The lines below have all 5 steps. It may be easier for you to use a shorter line with only your current step(s).
;;  - For Tarmak with Curl-DH, the first step has 5(6) changed keys. It's possible to first do the non-Curl step before swapping H-M.
;;  - The last lines allow you to use all the settings above, if that variant combo exists. Not all combos do! Check the Tarmak folder.
;;  - Since Tarmak layouts are in subfolders by ergo mod, make sure that CurlMod and HardMod are set to the right values as seen below.
;
;;  - Tarmak 0-5 roundtrip without ergo mods, for ISO or ANS. Set both CurlMod and HardMod to `--`.
;layout = @L-VK-QWE_@K:QWERTY(@K),@L-VK-Tm1_@K:Tarmak1(@K),@L-VK-Tm2_@K:Tarmak2(@K),@L-VK-Tm3_@K:Tarmak3(@K),@L-VK-Tm4_@K:Tarmak4(@K),@L-VK-Tm5_@K:Colemak(@K)-VK
;;  - Tarmak 1-5 with the Colemak-DH-Angle alias CurlAngle ergo mod, for ISO or ANS. Set CurlMod/HardMod to `Curl`/`Angle`.
;;  - The initial "baby" steps adding Curl and Angle gradually at the start may of course be skipped/deleted.

;;  - Tarmak 1-5 with the Curl-DH-Ortho ergo mod, for Ortho/Matrix/Column-staggered boards (w/o an Angle mod), for ISO or ANS.
;;  - Set CurlMod/HardMod to `Curl`/`--`. Also set KbdType to ISO-Orth or ANS-Orth as applicable.

;;  Colemak "edition DreymaR" or VirtualKey; switch to QWERTY with the same ergo mods except Curl/Other. For other main layouts like Dvorak, set LayMain above appropriately.
layout = @L-@T@V_@K@E:@L@V(@T) @E , QWERTY\QWE-@T_@K@H:QWERTY(@T) @H

;;  DEMO: Cycle through the Curl/Hard mods for ANS or ISO. LayMain = Colemak/Dvorak/QWERTY/QWERTZ are recommended, since not all ergo mods are available for other layouts.
