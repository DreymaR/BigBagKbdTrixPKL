;;  EPiKaL PortableKeyboardLayout settings file for EPKL by Øystein "DreymaR" Bech-Aase 2015-, from PKL by Máté Farkas.
;;  For more info, see the README files and the Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks: https://dreymar.colemak.org – select Windows.
;;  The old pkl.ini file held both layout choices, general settings and Extend. These are now separate files.
;;  For Layout choice and settings, use the EPKL_Layouts .ini file(s). For program settings, use EPKL_Settings.
;;  For each of these, there is a Default file and optionally an Override file, the settings in which take precedence.
;;  For Extend layer mappings (navigation/editing etc), use the _eD_Extend.ini file. Set the modifier key in your layout.
;;  In the Files folder there are also DeadKeys, Compose and PwrStrings files that contain different types of mappings.
;;  ================================================================================================================================
;
;;  Using the Settings GUI:
;;  - You can set many of the settings below with a handy EPKL Settings window from the EPKL Layout/Settings menu.
;;  - Any changes you submit from that window will be written to your Override file, thus taking precedence.
;;  - If you wish, you can then edit the entries manually in the Override file. You may also Reset them with a button.
;;  - The Settings GUI can also change the active layout and individual key mappings.
;
;;  EPKL Settings Default file info:
;;  - Any setting in this file may be overridden by a corresponding EPKL_Settings_Override.ini one.
;;  - Any settings in an EPKL_Settings_Override.ini file will override the corresponding Default settings.
;
;;  EPKL Settings syntax:
;;  - You can use yes/y/true/1 and no/n/false/0 as entry values for all Boolean (yes/no) choices.
;;  - To disable hotkeys in your Override file without touching the Default, you can set them to --.
;;    - Otherwise, simply comment their line(s) out with a semicolon in the Default file to disable them.

;;  Menu/dialog language: A file name in the Languages folder (without .ini).

menuLanguage    = auto  				; auto, or a Files\Languages file - Menu/dialog language

;;  Advanced Mode adds some items to menus and the About... dialog.
advancedMode    = yes   				; yes/no - Show extra info/options

;;  The default double-click menu item. Its text must match the item precisely, or you can use #& for position #.
;;  NOTE: AdvancedMode affects the number of menu entries. Hotkey full names may change depending on the settings.
trayMenuDefault = 7& 					; pos   - The nth menu entry including separator lines, by default Change layout
;trayMenuDefault = Change Layout (Ctrl+Shift+2) 	;   	- Names must match fully, including the hotkey part

;;  Help image settings.
showHelpImage   = yes 					; yes/no - Display the layout help image on startup

img_StartPos    = BM 					; TB+LMR - Initial help image position. Top/Bottom, Left/Middle/Right.
;;  Help image transparency. 0 is invisible, 255 opaque. < 0 for transparent background color (WIP).
img_Opacity     = 192   				; 0-255 	- 0 is invisible, 255 opaque
;;  The help images have individual size/scaling set in layout.ini. With the zoom hotkey you can change the global scale.
img_Zooms       = 50,100 ;,133  		; % 	- Start at the first zoom value, then cycle with the zoom hotkey
;;  Left, right, top and bottom margins for help images. A low margin of 40+ is above the menu bar.
;;  To show the help image on a second monitor, set margins < 0. I used (R,T) = (-1918,-118) for the upper right corner.

;;  Modifiers that are "Sticky" or "One-Shot" can be tapped then shortly thereafter type the key to be modded.
stickyMods      = LShift,RShift 		;   	- Sticky alias One-Shot mods (Note: RCtrl may interfere with AltGr)
stickyTime      = 500   				; ms 	- Sticky/One-Shot modifier tap time

;;  Tap-or-Modifier keys have a VK/ModName layout entry. To tap, release the key within the specified time if set > 0 ms.
tapModTime      = 250   				; ms 	- Tap-or-Mod/Dual-Role-Modifier tap time

;;  Extend modifiers let you select Multi-Extend layers: Ext+Mod1 -> Ext2; Ext+Mod2 -> Ext3; Ext+Mod1+Mod2 -> Ext4.
extendMods      = RAlt,RShift   		;   	- Mod1,Mod2

;;  Which Compose keys are used as CoDeKeys? That is, Compose+DeadKey, as explained elsewhere.
CoDeKeys        = CDK  ;,Def   			; ### 	- These Compose keys (without the ©) are also advanced CoDeKeys

;;  If your OS layout has dead keys, put them here. If, say, '^' is a dead key you must hit '^' then Space to type it.
;;  "--" or "none" will ignore this. If you write "auto", EPKL will look for the correct mode in the EPKL_Tables file.
systemDeadKeys  = auto  			; ¨´^`~ etc., --, auto (use tables) 	- The dead keys of your OS layout

;;  The "janitor" inactivity timer can clean up stuck modifiers. It also suspends EPKL by timer or active app, see below.
cleanupTimeOut  = 4 					; s 	- Idle time in sec. before janitor cleanup functions are performed
;;  If you often forget to exit EPKL at a shared computer, you can set suspend/exit timeouts in minutes.
;;  After this time without keypresses, EPKL will suspend itself and/or shut down.
suspendTimeOut  = 0 					; min 	- Idle time before EPKL is suspended by cleanup. 0 disables it.
exitAppTimeOut  = 0 					; min 	- Idle time before EPKL is shut down by cleanup. 0 disables it.

;;  The apps below will suspend EPKL while they're active. Use AHK window info as shown by the ProcStats hotkey.
;;  Window class is quite robust. Title will change with docs open etc., and .exe will match all apps with that name.
;;  Be aware that window titles may use the em dash (Colemak-eD AltGr+i) and it matters to title matching.
;;  Shorthand: Use 'C' for ahk_class and 'X' for ahk_exe matching. For title matching, use 'T' or just the window title.
suspendingApps  = X bash.exe 			; T/C/X win. 	- Autosuspend EPKL. Case matters. E.g., C WordPadClass, X Notepad.exe
;;  Layouts with these Locale IDs will suspend EPKL while they're active. Useful, say, if your IME conflicts with your layout.
suspendingLIDs  = -- 	;f0c1   		; --, 4-xdigit LocaleIDs; see the About... menu
;;  If startSuspended is active, EPKL will start up suspended. But it's probably better to just start EPKL when needed?
;startSuspended  = yes  				; Start EPKL in the Suspended state

;;  Compact mode: The layout file is in the same folder as EPKL.exe
compactMode     = no 					; Run EPKL in compact mode (layout in root folder)
