;;  Program Settings Default file
;;  for EPiKaL Portable Keyboard Layout (EPKL) by Øystein "DreymaR" Bech-Aase (2015-), based on PKL by Máté Farkas (2008-2010).
;;  For more info, see the README files and the Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks: https://dreymar.colemak.org – select Windows.
;
;;  - For Layout choice and settings, use the EPKL_Layouts .ini file(s). For program settings, use EPKL_Settings.
;;  - For each of these, there is a Default file and optionally an Override file, the settings in which take precedence.
;;  - For Extend layer mappings (navigation/editing etc), see the _eD_Extend.ini file. Set the modifier key in any active LayStack file.
;;  - In the Files folder there are Compose, DeadKeys, Extend, PwrStrings and Remap special files with different types of entries.
;;  ================================================================================================================================================
;
;;  The EPKL Settings GUI:
;;  - You can set many of the settings below with a handy EPKL Settings window from the EPKL Layout/Settings menu.
;;  - Any changes you submit from that window will be written to your Override file, thus taking precedence.
;;  - If you wish, you can then edit the entries manually in the Override file. You may also Reset them with a button.
;;  - The Settings GUI can also change the active layout, special keys (Extend and Compose) and individual key mappings.
;
;;  EPKL Settings syntax:
;;  - You can use yes/y/true/1 and no/n/false/0 as entry values for all Boolean (yes/no) choices.
;;  - To disable hotkeys or other settings in your Override file without touching the Default, you can set them to --.
;;    - Otherwise, simply comment their line(s) out with a semicolon in the Default file to disable them.
;
;;  EPKL Settings Default file info:
;;  - Any settings in an EPKL_Settings_Override.ini file will override the corresponding Default settings in this file.

;;  If your OS layout has dead keys, put them here. If, say, '^' is a dead key you must hit '^' then Space to type it.

;;  The apps below will suspend EPKL while they're active. Use AHK window info as shown by the ProcStats hotkey.
;;  Window class is quite robust. Title will change with docs open etc., and .exe will match all apps with that name.
;;  Be aware that window titles may use the em dash (Colemak-eD AltGr+i) and it matters to title matching.
