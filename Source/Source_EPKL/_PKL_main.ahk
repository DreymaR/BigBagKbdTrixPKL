;		- Cmk-CAWS-eD MicroSoft Keyboard Layout Creator `.KLC` files in `Other\MSKLC`, both ISO-Angle and an ANSI-Angle(Z) versions. Builds in `.zip` files.
;		- Added palatal-hook letters to the ogonek-commabelow DK, as only the s mapping overlapped. Mapped ᶊ to ß (AltGr+s) for this DK.
;			- Also, Macron-Below on the Macron key, more special digits and several other new mappings. Reworked turnstiles on the Science DK.
;		- Added `FRST/WP` arrow symbols to the Macron DK. `FRST` is an arrow cross, `WP` left-right and up-down arrows. Single on unshifted, double on shifted and AltGr.
;			- These arrow symbol mappings are geometrically mapped in a Colemak-centric way. For another layout, revision may be desirable.
;		- You can hide the images for a specific dead key, rather than dead key images in general. To hide all DK images, specify 'DKs' (WIP).
;		- Fixed: Shifted state entries with an unshifted character would get the character shifted by sticky Shift. This is the case for Dvorak Sym.
;			- As a fix, the offending entries were given `→` prefixes so they're sent literally.
;			- Note that Win+‹key› (here Win+number) shortcuts won't work with this kind of mapping. I don't know a fix that works in both cases.
;		- Fixed: The caron dead key in the MSKLC files was missing the important Čč entries.
;		- Fixed: Several language files had the wrong encoding so menus became full of `�` symbols.
;		- Prefix-Entry documentation updated, in main and Files README. Also added to the KeyMapper Help screen.
;		- The "kaomoji" speech bubbles and other links are now PowerStrings, and their Compose and DeadKey entries updated.
;		- Remaps in BaseLayout files are now fully respected on their own, so a Remap section in the layout.ini file is no longer mandatory.
;		- Added the Semimak-JQ variant. It's a little Q > J > QU cycle from the original.
;		- Dead key images for Colemak-CAW variants now point to CAWS images since I'll be trying to support only the best and most popular combos.
;		- Reworked the Greek Colemak locale layouts, replacing the rare diaeresis letters on Q and ISO with Tonos/Diaeresis DKs and the default Compose.
;			- Note that Compose allows accented/polytonic Greek letters to be written as sequences using punctuation.

;		- Dual-function Compose/DK "CoDeKey": If a sequence isn't recognized by the Compose key, it becomes a dead key (@co0) instead.
;			- Since it's still slightly Work-In-Progress, it isn't on by default. Turn it on using an `EPKL_Layouts` override defining `@co0`.
;			- If `@co0` is undefined (or defined as '--'), the Compose key does nothing after an unrecognized sequence, like it used to.
;			- This seems very nice for locale layouts' special letters. I've put mine next to the ISO-Compose key for easy rolls.
;			- I've also tested out punctuation-plus-space home row mappings, ++ on the `NEIO;UY'-` keys. These seem very promising!
;			- The punctuation CoDeKey, in my experience, works wonderfully with a thumb Compose key like the key-next-to-RAlt.
;			- Several default X11 sequences cause trouble with this: `c+<letter>` (caron), `b+<letter>` (breve), `ng` for ŋ, `ae` for æ etc.
;			- I had to nuke/unselect most one-char composes/completions, to make sure we don't stumble over a sequence when wanting the DK.
;				- Some sequences were restored with a leading apostrophe, like for instance `'ng` instead of just `ng` for ŋ.
;		- Added a separate dead key for the Shift-Compose mapping, `@co1`. If using the CoDeKey © key, we'll have both @co0 and @co1.
;			- For now, it points to the Ext_Command release table. Slight problem: Its releases are Shift sensitive, so mind Sticky Shift timing.
;		- Fixed: Generating all DK images didn't generate the Co0 ones, because Co0 isn't used directly in any layout mappings. Added a check around the © key.
;		- Changed the Prefix-Entry prefix for Unicode points from `«` to `†` to accommodate the new `«»` HIG prefix. Plus, it looks nicer. Still using `~` for it.


;; ================================================================================================
;;  eD TOFIX/WIP:
;		- WIP: 

;		- TODO: Add a Help button with a more generic help screen for the first Settings UI panel?
;		- TODO: Move the text for the Settings UI help text to the language files?!
;			- Make a separate .ini file section for it. Then read in the whole section and process it?

;		- TOFIX: Hiding a DK image triggered by an AltGr+<key> DK fails: The AltGr help image gets stuck instead if it happens too fast. Affects hiding 'DKs'.
;		- WIP: The CoDeKey sends repeated spaces when held down. Is this desirable? Could we specify no output by default for a DK?
;		- WIP: Edit the prefix-entry section in the Extend and README files, and add one to the KeyMapper Help screen
;		- WIP: Special Keys tab for the Settings UI!?!
;		- WIP: Ensure PrtScn is sent right for the CoDeKey and other DKs. Need PrtScn (all active windows), Alt+PrtScn (active window) and Win+PrtScn (full screen)
;		- WIP: Redo the images for changed DKs. Macron, Ring-Lig, Currency, DblAcute-Sci, Breve, DotBelow
;		- WIP: Check out https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=77668&sid=15853dc42db4a0cc45ec7f6ce059c2dc about image flicker.
;			- May not work with WinSet, Transparent; I'm using that with the Help Images.
;		- TOFIX: Some new DK sequences don't work, like `~22A2   =  ~22AC	; ⊢ ⇒ ⊬`. Others like `~2228   =  ~22BD	; ∨ ⇒ ⊽` work. What gives?
;			- Also iota/upsilon with dialytika and tonos don't work...?
;		- TOFIX: When selecting downwards with Extend and then using Extend-copy, sometimes an 'EXT' character (?) is made instead.

;		- WIP: To work everywhere, the HIG tag will have to be in the prefix parser itself nevertheless and not in pkl_init, won't it?
;			- Make HIG call ParseSend w/ a "HIG" setting (now "ParseOnly") which then gets the tag if applicable or the entry otherwise as now
;			- Call hig_tag() first in ParseSend() to lop off the tag

;		- TOFIX: Win+V can't paste when using ergo-modded layouts like AWide. However, with CAWS and Vanilla it works.
;			- Is this because of the VK detection making an error? The ones that work both have V in its old place.

;		- TODO: Add a display abbreviation to prefix-entry syntax, so help images can show what's going on? E.g., `«»`.
;			- For good efficiency during typing, do this at init? Lop off the display bit and store it so HIG can find it if necessary.
;				- For DKs it'll have to happen at runtime though, so we'll probably need to do it in ParseSend() too.
;			- Probably can't have more than two characters or it'll be too wide? But try it out w/ `Esc` for instance.
;				- Eventually, may reduce the font size automatically if more than 2 characters?
;				- But – check U+2423⇒␣ (space), U+2408⇒␈ (BS), U+241B⇒␛ (ESC), U+2421⇒␡ (DEL)...! U+23FB⇒⏻ (Power), U+2328⇒⌨ (keeb).
;				- From the Unicode Control Pictures block: https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/control_pictures/list.htm
;				- Also use symbols like ↓↑←→ used in the Extend images. U+21B5⇒↵ (Enter). U+23CE⇒⏎ (Enter), U+232B⇒⌫ (BS), U+2326⇒⌦ (Del)...
;				- From the Unicode Misc. Technical block: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/block/U+2300
;				- From the Unicode Arrow Symbols block: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/block/U+2190
;			- Better: Figure out sizes for 1,2,3,4(+?) character tags. Calculate, or tabulate from the settings file? The latter is more flexible.
;				- In the .svg file: 'font-size:32px', ahead of the '<text>' tags. Need to rework the regex a bit to incorporate that.
;				- In my "IBM board" file, Esc is 14px as is F##/Ctrl/Ins/Del/End, PrntSc/SysRq 11.5px, Scroll+Lock/Page+Up 12.5px, Pause/Break 12px
;				- So a useful size array could be something like 32,24,16,14,12? Try it out.
;			- Example: «^Z»β{Esc}^z  		; Undo (on the Compose DK @co0)
;			- Example: «,_»α{,}{Space}  	; Comma-Space (on @co0)
;			- Is it bad to only use it for Prefix-Entry though? Should we use it for other strings as well? But they could just use, e.g., → syntax.

;		- TODO: Flesh out menu entries in the Settings UI? For instance, ANS ⇒ ANS(I), AWide ⇒ AWide (Angle+Wide) etc. Use a dictionary of string replacements?

;		- TODO: Move all override (and settings?) files to the Data folder? More compatible w/ the PortableApps format (backup++), but less clear?

;		- TEST: To avoid DK images stuck in the AltGr state, use a slight delay before showing the image if it's DK? It's a dirty hack, but could it help?
;			- Would destroying the GUI on DK activation help at all?

;		- WIP: Decide on supporting DK images and suchlike only for Cmk vanilla, CA and CAWS. Drop CAW support for sanity; link to CAWS in files.
;			- There is also AWide support today. But... I don't think a lot of people use it? And they can always be asked to generate their own.

;		- TODO: New tab on the Settings GUI? "Special Keys"? Make some common things more newb-friendly: Caps behavior, Sticky mods, Compose (@co1), hotkeys...?
;			- One sub-panel for Layout (Caps, Compose) and one for Setting (Sticky, ...?) overrides.
;			- For ISO/ANS, a setting for the OEM_102 or RWin or Z(?) key that allows Co(DeKey)? Or ®® etc
;				- Format the key line based on which key is chosen (using the Z key requires having Z on AltGr... and on a nearby key...? ugh)?
;				- The key next to RAlt is good for Compose. Which key that is, varies: Most common is RWin; Lenovo has PrtSc. Menu/APP(S) is a fairly unused key.
;				- Add a check box for whether to make it a CoDeKey (w/ @co0 DK)
;				- Selection for what to do with @co1 too? Too advanced for most?
;			- Text suggestions for the Caps key behavior panel:
;				- CapsLock  	(wasted)
;				- Backspace 	(oki...)
;				- Extend    	(wowza!)
;				- Back/Extend 	(fancy!)
;				- Mother-of-DKs (POWAH!)
;			- Also a Hotkeys panel?
;			- Menu language choice (on the Settings tab), with a dropdown choice of the actual language files present?

;		- WIP: Add "What about gaming?" to README. Explain send method vs VK (also Compose etc). Mention MSKLC CAWS and SharpKeys.
;		- WIP: Introduce the marvelous Compose key in the README! Need more documentation on its merits. Also the new CoDeKey (dual-role Compose/Dead Key).
;			- Become a Great Composer!

;		- WIP: Can we have a separate user working dir, so users have their settings elsewhere? Very nice idea!
;			- https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/issues/34
;			- Make and look for overrides in the working dir, and defaults in the script dir.
;			- Add a syntax or setting that lets the user specify using a layout dir (and BaseLayout?) in the working dir. Or just look for it there first, if different?
;				- `User\` or `~\` could point to working dir, and `.\` continue to point to script dir? Need to make all file-reading operations aware of this!?
;			- Might use a switch of working dir for some operations? Or, should things like the HIG just assume working dir and anyone wishing to use it must adjust?
;				- This would make sense, in letting a user set individual settings in their working dir and getting images there too.
;			- By default, the working dir can be Data which is the right place for it in the PortableApps standard (for backup).

;		- TODO: Allow a BaseLayout stack: Variant,Options/Script,Base... ?
;			- Make BaseVariants so we don't have to repeat ourselves for locales. The layout.ini could just hold the ergo remaps.
;			- The Cmk-Kyr BaseLayout could for instance base itself on the Cmk-eD BaseLayout and then Cmk-Ru-CAWS on Cmk-Kyr w/ remaps; Bg with its own variant.
;			- Guard against infinite recursion. Limit LayStack depth to a few more layers? Two more could be nice, for instance one locale plus one with extra composes?
;			- Figure out a way to sort out the img_ entries too, without manually editing all of them? Soft/hard? Extend(@X)/Geometric(@H)?

;		- WIP: Implement SGCaps, allowing Shift State +8 for a total of 16 possible states - in effect 4 more states than the current 4, disregarding Ctrl.
;			- Kindly sponsored by Rasta at the Colemak Discord!
;			- The states themselves are already implemented? So what remains is a sensible switch. "Lvl8|SGCap Modifier"? Can translate in _checkModName()
;			- May have to clean up the state calculation in _keyPressed()
;			- This should be the ideal way of implementing mirrored typing? (On the Lenovo Thinkpad there's even a thumb PrtSc/SC137 key that could serve as switch.)
;			- For fun, could make a mirror layout for playing the crazy game Textorcist: Typing with one hand, mirroring plus arrowing with the other!
;			- Make a lock variant of the modifier

;		- WIP: Since Compose tables can be case sensitive now, do the same for DKs? Then scrap the silly `<K>+`-type DK entry syntax - keep <#> syntax?
;			- Read in all DK tables in use at startup instead of each entry as needed then? Faster use, slower startup, more memory usage. Acceptable?

;		- WIP: Instead of doing the atKbdType() this-and-that routine, make a fn to interpret all @ codes and add it as a switch for pklIniRead()?
;			- This would allow the use of all @ codes in all LayStack files

;		- WIP: "Add Layout" functionality in GUI, to select multiple active layouts without editing files manually.
;			- Use the ComboBox functionality, that lets you have a DDL with a manually editable field on top.
;			- Use an Add button? The button adds layout, line becomes <lay1>, then add is grayed out until something's changed. Could I avoid an extra button?
;			- Or... a cheeky Join button that uses RegExReplace to merge the topmost two GUI override entries?! Too risky and error-prone for newbs.

;		- WIP: In the Janitor timer: Update the OS dead keys and OEM VKs as necessary. Register current LID and check for changes.
;		- TOFIX: The detectCurrentWinLayVKs() fn is doing something wrong now? Trying to use the whole SCVKdic produces lots of strange entries...?
;		- TOFIX: Need to SC remap the OEMdic or layouts with ergo remaps will get it wrong. Example: Ctrl+Z on Angle stopped working when remapping QW_LG VK by SC.
;			- In pkl_init, make a pdic[SC] = VK where SC is the remapped SC codes for the OEM keys, and VK what VK they're mapped to (or -1 if VKey mapped)
;			- And/or a VK(ANSI)-to-VK(OS-layout) remap pdic?
;			- Just detect every single VK code from the OS layout: It'd fix all our VK troubles, and account for such things as my CAWS OS layout.
;		- TOFIX: System layout is faulty? OEMs are wrong.
;			- If I get it working, add a section to the README with "I don't want Colemak"? For people who just want Extend on top of their OS layout

;		- WIP: Get started on the Arabic phonetic layout!

;		- WIP: Revisit the ISO key for several locale variants as the new Compose key is so powerful. Spanish? Probably not Scandi/German? Or?

;		- WIP: Make README.md for the main layout and layout variant folders, so they may be showcased on the GitHub site.
;			- This way, people may read, e.g., IndyRad/QI analysis on the GitHub page in Markdown rather than the unattractive comment format.
;			- Update correspondence between the Locale Forum topic and these pages: Link to EPKL in the topic, get info from the topic.

;		- WIP: Mother-of-DKs (MoDK), e.g., on Extend tap! Near endless possibilities, especially if dead keys can chain.
;			- MoDK idea: Tap Ext for chaining DK layer (e.g., {Ext,a,e} for e acute – é?). But how best to organize them? Mnemonically is not so ergonomic.

;		- WIP: Dual-role modifiers. Allow home row modifiers like for instance Dusty from Discord uses: ARST and OIEN can be Alt/Win/Shift/Ctrl when held. Define both KeyDn/Up.
;			- In the EPKL_Settings .ini, set a tapOrModTapTime. In layout, use SC### = VK/ModName first entries. The key works normally when tapped, and the Mod is stored separately.
;			- Redefine the dual-role Extend key as a generic tapOrMod key. Treating Extend fully as a mod, it can also be ToM (or sticky?).
;			- TOFIX: ToM-tap gets transposed when typing fast, the key is sluggish. But if the tap time is set too low, the key can't be tapped instead.
;				- To fix this, registered interruption. So if something is hit before the mod timer the ToM tap is handled immediately.
;				- However, Spc isn't handled correctly!? It still gets transposed.
;			- Make a stack of active ToM keys? Ensuring that they get popped correctly. Nah...?
;			- Should I support multi-ToM or not? Maybe two, but would need another timer then like with OSM.

;		- TOFIX: Help images show 3–4× at startup with a slightly longer Sleep to hopefully avoid a minimize-to-taskbar bug on the first hide image.
;			- It still doesn't work as it should, but the problem is hard to reproduce.
;		- TOFIX: Looks like there are multiple EPKL instances in the Tray now? Is that true? Can it be GUI windows? Refresh related?
;		- TOFIX: Ext-Shift may get stuck until Ext is released. Not sure exactly how.
;		- TOFIX: Help images for Colemak-Mirror don't show the apostrophe on AltGr even though it's functional and defined equivalently to the base state one.
;			- Debug on 6_BS doesn't show any differences; looks like &quot; is still generated.
;		- FIXED: Removed pressing LCtrl for AltGr (as in pkl_keypress.ahk now!). And changed to {Text} send.
;			- Does it fix the problem with upgrading to a newer AHK version?!? No! LCtrl still gets stuck upon AltGr in AHK v1.1.28+.
;		- TOFIX: Update to newer AHK! v1.1.28.00 worked mostly but not for AltGr which sends Alt and gets Ctrl stuck. v1.1.27.07 works fully.
;			- AHK version history: "Optimised detection of AltGr on Unicode builds. This fixes a delay which occurred at startup (v1.1.27) or the first Send call (earlier)."
;			- After update past v1.1.28, we can use StrSplit() with MaxParts to allow layout variant names with hyphens in them!
;			- Should then be able to go to v1.1.30.03 right away, but check for v1.1.31? That version has added an actual switch command, though!!!
;		- TOFIX: Setting a hotkey to, e.g., <^<+6 (LeftCtrl & LeftShift & 6) doesn't work.
;		- TOFIX: If a DK is selected very fast, the AltGr DK state image may get stuck until release. This happened after adding the DK img refresh-once timer?
;			- Renamed any state6 DK images that contained only a base key release on Spc, to miminize this issue. DKs like Ogonek still have it.
;		- TOFIX: The ToM MoDK Ext doesn't always take when tapped quickly. Say I have period on {Ext-tap,i}. I'll sometimes get i and/or a space instead.
;			- Seems that {tap-Ext,i} very fast doesn't take (producing i or nothing instead of ing)? Unrelated to the ToM term.
;		- TOFIX: Mapping a key to a modifier makes it one-shot?!
;		- TOFIX: -- remap mapping settings in layout.ini fail.
;		- TOFIX: Redo the AltGr implementation.
;			- Make a mapping for LCtrl & RAlt, with the layout alias AltGr?! That'd pick up the OS AltGr, and we can then do what we like with it.
;			- Treat EPKL AltGr as a normal mod, just that it sends <^>! - shouldn't that work? Maybe an alias mapping AltGr = <^>!
;		- TOFIX: The NBSP mapping (AltGr+Spc), in Messenger at least, sends Home or something that jumps to the start of the line?! The first time only, and then normal Space?
;		- TOFIX: Remapping to LAlt doesn't quite work? Should we make it recognizeable as a modifier? Trying 'SC038 = LAlt VK' also disabled Extend?
;		- TEST: ToM Ctrl on a letter key? Shift may be too hard to get in flow, but Ctrl on some rare keys like Q or D/H would be much better than awkward pinky chording.
;			- It works well! But then after a while it stops working?
;		- TESTING: Use the laptop PrtScr key for something? It's thumb accessible w/ the Wide mod. Corresponds to the Menu key on many other boards. Compose key!!!
;			- Try Alt as thumb-Ext, Caps as Alt? AltGr as Shift, PrtScr as AltGr?

;; ================================================================================================
;;  eD TONEXT:
;		- TODO: IPA Compose sequences, based on my old IPA DK ideas. Vowels with numbers according to position?
;		- TODO: Make a "base compose output" that a Compose key releases whenever no sequence is recognized? Like the Basechar of a DK. Useful for locale layouts?
;		- TODO: UI Idea: Show the state0 (and state3 if available) image of the chosen layout, in the picker?! Preferably with the right background. 
;			- Possible to extract the pic from pkl_gui_image?
;		- TODO: Personal override files for extend, compose, powerstrings etc? One override file with sections? Some overrides (remaps, DKs) in layouts.
;		- TODO: Lose the ANS2ISO VKEY maps in all layouts and the Remap file since they're based on flawed logic?
;		- TODO: Rewrite the Tarmak layouts with remaps instead of explicit mappings. As of today, Extend isn't remapped correctly for all CurlAngle steps.
;		- TODO: Is the main README still too long? Put the layout tutorial in a Layouts README? Also make a tutorial for simply using the CkAWS remap or something.
;		- TODO: A Wide mod that supports the QI;x or CTGAP bottom-right-half-row. Where he has `_B _H SL PD CM`, make the Wide mod `SL _B _H PD` and move CM up.
;			- Or... Would that suck? It replaces the safe E-SL SFB with E-B which is much worse?
;		- TODO: Add QWERTZ and AZERTY layouts? There are now remaps for them, and the rest should be doable with OEM VK detection.
;		- TODO: Provide a swap-LAlt-n-Caps RegEdit script, and a reversal one. Maybe add some more codes in the comments, see my old RegEdit scripts.
;		- TODO: Harmonize Ext and folder mod names? And/or make a shorthand for the @E=@C@H@O battery in addition to @K in layout files? And also the short variant like CAW(S)?
;			- Could expand, e.g., CurlAWide to CurlAngleWide for the layout name only? Or use long names like CurlAWideSym consistently?
;			- Make long names more consistent? Like 4 letters per mod, CurlAnglWideSyms ? Nah, too anal. Better to keep with CurlAWideSym, and that's long enough really.
;			- Use CAngle or CA--, etc? CAngle is more intuitive, but CA more consistent with CAW(S). 
;		- TODO: Make a matrix image template, and use it for the Curl variants w/o Angle. 
;			- Maybe that should be a separate KbdType, but we also need ANS/ISO info for the VK conversions. ASM/ISM KbdTypes?
;		- TOFIX: I messed up Gui Show for the images earlier, redoing it for each control with new img titles each time. Maybe now I could make transparent color work? No...?
;		- TOFIX: If a layout have fewer states (e.g., missing state2) the BaseLayout fills in empty mappings in the last state! Hard to help? Mark the states right in the layout.
;		- TOFIX: Pressing a DK twice should release basechar1 (s1) but basechar0 (s0) is still released. Not sure why.

;; ================================================================================================
;;  eD TODO:
;		- TODO: Could I turn around the Compose method, to be leader key after all? But how to input then? Without looking sucks. In a pop-up box?
;		- TODO: Offer VK layouts based on the eD ones! Use only the state0/1 images then.
;			- Let the Layout Picker show VK if VK or other kinds are available. With the LayType setting, use a VK if the layout is present but if not, look for eD.
;			- Let the generated VK layout convert to VK in BaseLayout only! That way, we could have state mapped overrides in layout.ini, and thus locale VK variants!
;			- With this, we could reduce the number of folders and more or less duplicate files a lot.
;		- TODO: Color markings for keys in HIG images! Could have a layer of bold key overlays and mark the keys we want with colors through entries in the HIG settings file.
;			- markColors = #c00:_E/_N/_K, #990:_B/_T/_F, #009:_J     ; Tarmak2 colors
;			- markColors = <CSV of marking specs>, similar to the remaps. Could have Tarmak1,Tarmak2,Tarmak3,#009:_J ?
;			- See https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1858-learn-colemak-in-steps-with-the-tarmak-layouts/p4/#p23659
;			- Allow a section in layout.ini too!
;			- Mark differently by state, as in the Tarmak images
;		- TODO: Make state images and DK image dirs ISO/ANSI aware?! Generate both in the HIG each time. Make layouts that can handle both. 
;			- How to handle special mappings? Could have [layout_###] sections.
;		- TODO: I never use the SendMessage parse prefix. Cannibalize it for a strEsc() send? Or add that as €\ prefix instead?
;		- Mod ensemble: For lr in [ "", "L", "R" ], For mod in [ "Shift", "Ctrl", "Alt", "Win" ] ? May not always need the empties? Also add [ "CapsLock", "Extend", "SGCaps" ] ?
;		- TODO: Redo the @Ʃ_@Ç formalism, adding @K to @E(@C@H@O) by a hyphen instead of an underscore? Would that be a benefit in any way? Or just a lot of work?
;		- TODO: Hotstrings? May have to wait for AHK v1.1.28 to use the Hotstring() fn? Or is there somewhere in this script we could insert definitions?
;		- TODO: Consider a remap for each Ext layer? Would make things messier, but allows separate Ext1 and Ext2 maps, e.g., for the SL-BS switch.
;			- Allow mapSC_extend2 etc entries in the LayStack. If not specified, use the _extend one for all.
;		- TODO: Add ABNT keys to the HIG template?
;		- TODO: Record macro? Or just a way to set entries for a certain DK layer in the Settings UI? Say, the Ext-tap layer(s). Could have backup DK layers and a Reset button.
;		- TODO: Make EPKL able to hold more than one layout in memory at once?! This would make dual layouts smoother, and using layouts as layers (Greek, mirroring etc) possible.
;			- With SGCaps modifier layers, the need for this may be alleviated?
;		- TODO: Since no hotkeys are set for normal key Up, Ext release and Ext mod release won't be registered? Should this be remedied?
;		- TODO: Rework the modifier Up/Down routine? 
;			- A function pklSetMods( set = 0, mods = [ "mod1", "mod2", ... (can be just "all")], side = [ "L", "R" ] ) could be nice? pkl_keypress, pkl_deadkey, in pkl_utility
;		- TODO: Replace today's AltGr handling with an AltGr modifier. You'd have to map, e.g., RAlt = AltGr Modifier, but then all the song-and-dance of today would be gone.
;			- Note that we both need to handle the AltGr EPKL modifier and whether the OS layout has an AltGr key producing LCtrl+RAlt on a RAlt press.
;			- Also allow ToM/Sticky AltGr. Very very nice since AltGr mappings are usually one-shot.
;			- Define a separate AHK hotkey for LCtrl+RAlt (=AltGr in Windows)? That might make things simpler.
;		- TODO: VK mappings don't happen on normal keys. Simple VK code states don't get translated to VK##. Only used when the key is VK mapped.
;		- TODO: Instead of CompactMode, allow the Layouts_Default (or _Override) to define a whole layout if desired. Specify LayType "Here" or suchlike?
;			- At any rate, all those mappings common to eD and VK layouts could just be in the Layouts_Default.ini file. That's all from the modifiers onwards.
;		- TODO: Import KLC. Use a layout header template.
;			- Could have a section of RegEx conversions with name tags in the template, which gets used and then cut out.
;			- Each such entry could have a tagName = ## SplitBy JoinBy <regex>
;				- Allow both RegExReplace and RegExMatch entries? The latter should use O) match objects?
;				-  The ## denotes how many numbered entries should be run on this string. This could have sublevels, like ##-##-##.
;				- SplitBy loops through elements of the string, recursively if subentries also split. Then it's rejoined with JoinBy (necessary, or just regex that?).
;				- Can we SplitBy words, like \nDEADKEY\t ?
;			- Then in the template there's something like $$tagName$$ where the result is to be inserted.
;			- For DK full names, the KEYNAME_DEAD entries could be converted (cut out ACCENT/SIGN, _ for spaces?, cut away parentheses, title case). Update my names accordingly?
;			- In addition to MSKLC format, allow Aldo Gunsing's KLFC! https://github.com/39aldo39/klfc And maybe Keyboard Layout Editor's KLE (or do that via KLFC).
;		- TODO: Make pklParseSend() work for DK chaining (one DK releases another)!
;			- Today, a special DK entry will set the PVDK (DK queue) to ""; to chain dead keys this should this happen for @ entries?
;			- Removing that isn't enough though? And actually, should a dk chaining start anew? So, replicate the state and effect of a normal layout DK press.
;			- Chaining DKs opens up for interesting possibilities, like a Mother-of-Dead-Keys key (MoDK)! Could that be on Extend-tap, possibly with a timeout? Or on Backspace?
;				- See Jaroslaw's MoDK topic in the Forum: https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2501-my-current-programming-symbols-layout/#p22527
;				- Placing all my DKs on MoDK sequences will fill up a layer. So maybe only the most interesting ones? But how to make it mnemonic?
;				- Example: Tap-dance {Ext,t,n} -> ñ; {Ext,a,A} -> Á; {Ext,0-9} IPA DKs.
;				- For good measure, could have different DKs on different states of the same key! Wow. The ToM formalism should support this actually!
;		- TODO: With the Compose method, look into IME-like behavior?
;			- This would allow "proper" Vietnamese, phonetic Kyrillic etc layouts instead of dead keys which work "the wrong way around".
;			- Could make special compose keys for accents? E.g., you type a^ and the ^ key is a Compose key producing â.
;		- TODO: Make EPKL work with the .exe outside a .zip file? 
;			- You could then download the release .zip, put the .exe outside, change then rezip any settings you want to, then the .exe will use the archive.
;			- This may be desirable for people running EPKL from an URL. It's easier to handle two files than several folders.
;		- TODO: Try out <one Shift>+<other Shift> = Caps? How to do that? Some kind of ToM, where the Shift is Shift when held but Caps when (Shift-)tapped?
;		- TODO: The key processing timers generate autorepeat? Is this desirable? It messes with the ToM keys? Change it so the hard down sends only down and not down/up keys?
;		- TODO: Keylogging for gathering typing stats. Which stats? 1-2-3-grams, characters-before-backspace...
;		- TODO: A help fn to make layout images? Make the image large and opaque, then make a screenshot w/ GIMP and crop it. Or can I use the Windows Snipping Tool (Win+Shift+S)?
;		- TODO: AHK2Exe update from AutoHotKey v1.1.26.1 to v1.1.30.03 (released April 5, 2019) or whatever is current now. 	;eD WIP: Problem w/ AltGr?
;			- New Text send mode for PowerStrings, if desired. Should handle line breaks without the brkMode setting.
;		- TODO: Make the Japanese layout now, since dead keys support literals/ligatures and DK tables in layout.ini are possible.
;		- TODO: Hebrew layout. Eventually, Arabic too.
;		- TODO: Mirrored one-hand typing as Remap, Extend or other layer?
;			- For Extend, would need a separate Ext modifier for it? E.g., NumPad0 or Down for foot or right-arm switching. But is that too clunky?
;			- SGCaps could work, but would require each layout to have SGC mappings to allow mirroring then. And a separate SGC modifier.
;			- Layout switching is usually done by restarting EPKL which is too clunky. But if we could have a switch modifier that temporarily activates the next layout...?
;			- This would require preloading more than one layout which takes a bit of reworking. Possibly... Allow an alt-set of the remap only, remapping on the fly w/ a mod?
;			- Mirroring as a remap can now use minicycles of many two-key loops. For instance, |  QU |  SC /  MN |  SL | for two separate swaps.
;		- TODO: A set of IPA dk, maybe on AltGr+Shift symbol keys? Could also be chained from a MoDK?
;		- TODO: Lose CompactMode from the Settings file. The LayStack should do it.
;			- Instead of a setting in Settings, allow all of the layout to reside in EPKL_Layouts_Default (or Override). If detected, use root images if available.
;			- If no layout.ini is found, give a short Debug message on startup explaining that the root level default/override layout, if defined, will be used. Or just do it?

;; ================================================================================================
;;  eD ONHOLD:
;		- Instead of having to make special literal entries (`→` or similar) for unshifted characters in shifted states, make all character sends use Unicode/Text?
;			- Issue: With Sticky Shift, the 2nd state mapping is sent shifted which is wrong if it was mapped to be something unshifted. Normal Shift does not.
;			- Sticky Shift just holds down the Shift key which leads to this effect. Should I make sure the state map is sent unblind?
;			- Only happens for single-character mappings. Mappings that aren't a key name aren't sent as "keys" by AHK.
;			- Conclusion: Not a good idea to send as text categorically, as non-"key" sending breaks Win+‹key› shortcuts.
;		- Try out a swap-side layout instead of the mirrored one? More strain on weak fingers, but fewer SFBs I should think.
;			- Is the brain equally good at side-swapping and mirroring?
;		- Make it so that if the hotkey queue overflows it's reset and you lose, say, the last 10 keys in it? Is that actually safer? No, don't think so?
;			- Need a way to count the hotkeys then, without spending much resources. The size of pklHotKeyBuffer should be an indication, as it's usually 'SC###¤' repeated.
;			- Only necessary to intervene on hotkey #31? Then stop the first 16 or so timers and flush the corresponding pklHotKeyBuffer entries.
;		- Make @K a compound (ANS/ISO-Trad/Orth/Splt/etc)? ANS/ISO is needed for VK codes, and the form factor for images and layout subvariants. kbdType vs kbdForm?
;			- Could keep everything in kbdType and adjust the reading of it to use the first and second substring.
;			- However, it may not be necessary at all. Using a kbdType like ANS-Orth seems to work just fine for now. The VK-related kbdType is in layout.ini anyway.
;		- Hardcode Tab instead of using &Tab after all? It's consistent to have both the whitespace characters Spc & Tab hardcoded this way.
;		- A dynamic key press indicator for help images, showing not just modifier layer but every press. Will it be fast enough? Needs a position table for each KbdForm.
;		- Make a Setting for which fn to run as Debug, so I don't have to recompile to switch debug fn()? Maybe overmuch, as the debug fn often needs recompiling anyway?
;		- Allow Remaps to use @K so that the layouts don't have to?!? Too confusing?
;		- Remove all the CtrlAltIsAltGr stuff? If laptops don't have RAlt (>!), they can just map a key to AltGr Mod instead? Won't allow using <^<! as AltGr (<^>!) though...
;		- Shift sensitive multi-Extend? When mapping for the NumPad layer, it'd be nice to have $/¢, €/£ etc. This allows many more potential mappings! 4×4-level Extend?!
;			- In most cases though, that'd be useful mostly for releasing more different glyphs. This is better done with dead keys, as these avoid heavy chording.
;		- Allow escaped semicolons (`;) in iniRead?
;		- Remove the Layouts submenu? Make it optional by .ini?
;		- Greek polytonic accents? U1F00-1FFE for circumflex(perispomeni), grave(varia), macron, breve. Not in all fonts! Don't use oxia here, as it's equivalent to tonos?
;		- Extend lock? E.g., LShift+Mod2+Ext locks Ext2. Maybe too confusing. But for, say, protracted numeric entry it could be useful?
;		- Some kaomoji have non-rendering glyphs, particularly eyes. Kawaii (Messenger), Joy face, Donger (Discord on phone). Just document and leave it at that.
;		- Go back on the Paste Extend key vs Ext1/2? It's ugly and a bit illogical since the layers are otherwise positional. But I get confused using Ext+D for Ctrl+V.
;		- Allow assigning several keys as Extend Modifier?
;		- An EPKL sample layout.ini next to the original PKL one, to illustrate the diffs? Or, let the contents of the main README be enough?
;		- Auto language detection doesn't follow keyboard setup but system language. If you use a Non-English keyboard but Windows uses English, the auto language is English.

;;  eD WIP: Map AltGr to RAlt to prevent trouble?!
;;  The order of AltGr is always LCtrl then RAlt. Custom combos always have the * (wildcard) mod so they obey any mod state.
