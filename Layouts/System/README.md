DreymaR's Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks - EPKL
===========================================
<br>

The EPKL System layout
---------------------------------
- The System layout is a passthrough layout, to use EPKL together with the current OS layout.
- It allows all keys to simply use their underlying Windows system layout mappings.
- It still allows EPKL bells-and-whistles like [Extend][BB_Ext], Compose and sticky mods.
- This should be quite unintrusive, but of course you won't get the eD symbol layers and dead keys.
- You could still add mappings to single keys as desired, for instance locale letters and a Compose key.
- If your system layout contains Wide and/or Angle mods, the mapSC_Extend setting will need adjusting for Extend.
- You may have to refresh EPKL whenever you change the underlying system layout.
- Since EPKL has no idea what your layout is now, you could add anything you like as your `state#.png` images.
- You can of course hide states (just showing Extend images), hide images (menu) or set `showHelpImage` to `no`.
