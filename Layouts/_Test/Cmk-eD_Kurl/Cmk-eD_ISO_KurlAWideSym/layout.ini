;;  Layout definitions
;;  for Portable Keyboard Layout by Farkas Máté [https://github.com/Portable-Keyboard-Layout]
;;  edition DreymaR (Øystein B Gadmar, 2015-)   [https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL]
;
;;  To use this layout, edit the EPKL_Layouts .ini 'layout = ' and/or Type/Mod/ID/etc entries.
;;  A simpler way is the Layout/Settings dialog from the EPKL tray menu (or try Ctrl+Shift+6).
;;  Alternatively, run EPKL in compactMode with the layout's files in the main program folder.
;
;;  This is an EPKL style layout.ini file
;;    - It may point to a base layout, Extend and DeadKey table files containing layout parts
;;    - The layout.ini file holds changes from the base layout, remaps and other layout info
;
;;  The V-K swap is a "bleeding-edge" Cmk mod idea to fix the KN/NK and KL/LK same-finger bigrams.
;;  Note that its benefits are very poorly documented. Alt-fingering the SFBs works very well too.
;;  Also, it creates an awkward CK bigram which analyzers may not pick up on as it isn't a SFB.
;;  The VE bigram also gets worse, and it's 3× as common as VK. These may be alt-fingered, but...
