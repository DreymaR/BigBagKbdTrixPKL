DreymaR's Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks - EPKL

_Test folder info
-----------------
This is where EPKL holds layouts that aren't fully tested as part of the BigBag, and/or don't quite belong in there ... yet?

If I wish to tuck something away because in my opinion it'd cause more confusion than necessary in one of the other folders, it may spend time in this folder. 
Some layouts require more testing, or their compatibility with my other mods and variants may be on the problematic side. There's already a lot of Colemak variants in the Colemak folder, for instance.

Some strange layouts are still out in the main folder for fun, such as the joke layouts QUARTZ (Perfect Pangram layout) and Foalmak (April's Foals layout). I should hope it's easy enough for users to get those jokes.
<br>

Implementation
--------------
To use any of these layouts, there are two main ways you can go:
- If you want to see the layout in the Layout/Settings menu, copy it over to a fitting main `Layouts\` folder.
    - Keep in mind that normally the first three letters of the MainLayout and layout variant folder must match.
    - Thus, if you put a variant inside the Colemak folder its folder name should begin with `Cmk` to be seen.
    - In any folder without a special abbreviation, just use the first three letters of its name.
- You could also point to it in an active `layout = ` line in your `EPKL_Layouts_Override.ini` file under the `[pkl]` section.
    - If you haven't got one, copy-paste one from the `EPKL_Layouts_Override_Example` file.
    - Example: `layout = _Test\Cmk-eD-QIx\Cmk-eD-QIx_ANS_CurlAngleSym:Cmk-TestLayout` for the Colemak-QI;x ANSI mod.

Simple Layout Analysis
----------------------
I've run some simple analysis, using the [ColemakMods Analyzer][CmmAna] with comparable settings:
- ColemakMods analysis was done on a 3×10 matrix with the upper right symbol kept as a semicolon if relevant, for fairness.
- Changes in base, SFB and total (which also includes "near-finger" bigram effort) were reported as Δ rel. to Colemak-DH.
- More analysis and observations regarding Nyfee's "Q" mods is found in the QI;x folder README.

In this analysis, simply swapping V and K and nothing else outperforms everything except ISRT!
- In effect though, it creates an awkward non-SFB CK bigram which the analyzer doesn't pick up on.
- VE/EV are also 3× more common than KE/EK and not too comfortable without alt-fingering.

**NotGate's ISRT/IndyRad layout** (QU -> SC for analysis; use w/ Sym mod)
```
    | Y C L M K  Z F U , ; |
    | I S R t g  P n e A o |
    | Q V W d J  B h / . x |

ISRT (homepage)   : 1.614   0.021   0.027   1.662   0.800     -0.016  -0.026  -0.025 !!! (6 swaps, 1 7-loop)
That analysis was done on an earlier version of the Colemakmods analyzer. The one in the table above is up-to-date.
```

Testing a column-swap: Cmk home row, ISRT upper/lower mappings ("**IndyPendant**")
```

    | a r s t g  P n e i o | (PM + Q, + WX.ZJVCFL)
    | . W V d J  B h / Q X |

"IndyPendant" loses on base/near-bigram effort in this analysis. Hard to assess its real qualities.
```

**NotGate's experimental SIND layout** (standard Sym mod not available)
```
    | y , h w f  q k o u x |
    | s i n d c  v t a e r |
    | j . l p b  g m ; / z |

This layout is a screwball: It may be good, but according to this analysis base+nfb efforts destroy the SFB benefit.
The ER/RE pinky bigrams contribute to the poor NFB score. The strongest fingers have the highest base efforts.

"IS COLEMAK-???/<YourLayoutHere> THE BEST LAYOUT?"
==================================================

No, it isn't. The best layout in all likelihood isn't made yet. And ultimately, the question is wrong.

At some point you reach the level of optimization where it's very hard to know what's really better, and what's better for me and you are different things. What's better for anyone may even change depending on what we're doing at the time. I may chat a lot, write scientific papers in English or write letters in Norwegian; there's no one layout that's ideal for all those usages. Therefore, we may optimize as far as we can see a point to it but still: **There isn't actually one one-size-fits-all best layout**.

At some point, the question doesn't even make sense. Typing additions like **Extend** and other helpful layers, **Compose/Completion** sequencing methods and **Sticky and/or home row modifiers** are a whole lot more useful to you than some key swaps in the end. What kind of **keyboard hardware** you're using may matter more than whether you're using so-and-so layout mod. At some point, squeezing out a few more analyzer points should become secondary to other typing improvements.

Another question to ask yourself is that of convenience. The most optimized layouts aren't available on Windows or MacOS; but then again all those other useful layout tools aren't either so maybe that doesn't matter to you. If you have a programmable keyboard or something like the **EPKL** program, some skills and time to spend, you can have nearly any layout with the additions you want. But if you aren't there, you may find that your best option is in fact vanilla Colemak (lots of available options for several OSes and platform) or even the aged and long-toothed Dvorak (comes preinstalled on Windows).

Colemak(-DH/-CAWS/-???) is a solid, balanced and useful choice, regardless. And that's my two bits.
