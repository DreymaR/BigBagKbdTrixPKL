;;  Layout Definition file
;;  for EPiKaL Portable Keyboard Layout (EPKL) by Øystein "DreymaR" Bech-Aase (2015-), based on PKL by Máté Farkas (2008-2010).
;
;;  - The Layout.ini file may point to a base layout as well as Extend and DeadKey table files.
;;  - It can override BaseLayout and EPKL_Layouts mappings, add key remaps and other layout info.
;;  - To use a layout, try the Layout/Settings dialog from the EPKL tray menu (or Ctrl+Shift+6).
;;  - Another way is to edit the EPKL_Layouts .ini 'layout = ' line and/or Type/Mod/ID/etc entries.
;;  - Alternatively, run EPKL in compactMode with the layout's files in the main program folder.

;;  The V-K swap is a "bleeding-edge" Cmk mod idea to fix the KN/NK and KL/LK same-finger bigrams.
;;  Note that its benefits are very poorly documented. Alt-fingering the SFBs works very well too.
;;  Also, it creates an awkward CK bigram which analyzers may not pick up on as it isn't a SFB.
;;  The VE bigram also gets worse, and it's 3× as common as VK. These may be alt-fingered, but...
