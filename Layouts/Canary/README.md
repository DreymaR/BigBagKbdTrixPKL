_The default Canary layout (using the Angle mod) on an ANSI keyboard_

<br><br>

The Canary layout
------------------
- This layout was made by layout creators at the AltKeyboardLayout Discord, including Apsu and Semilin.
- Its design is based on novel analysis and joint experience.
- It contains its own Curl(DH) mod, and is strongly recommended to Angle mod on row-staggered boards.
- On ortho boards, use `G > B > K` and `F > X > M` remaps [as explained in the Canary readme][CanOrt].
- For more info, see [the Canary layout repo on GitHub][CanGit].
