The Semimak layout
------------------
- This layout was made by Semilin alias Semi based on novel analysis techniques.
- Among other things, it uses his finger speeds for modeling instead of subjective weights.
- It also models some new factors like skipgrams (disjointed SFBs).
- For more info, see [the Semimak page on github.io][SemGit]
- Also, here's an interesting [reflection on Semimak by Semilin][Sem200] after hitting 200 WPM with it.
- An [**Angle**][ErgAWi] ergo mod is strongly recommended for this layout on row-staggered boards.
- For sanity, I moved the Semimak-eD `‚‘’` quotes so their relative positions match Colemak-eD.
<br>

This layout gets special mention in [Getreuer's Alt Keyboard Layout guide][GetAKL]. Have a look!
<br>

#### Semimak vanilla:
```
+----------------------------+
| f l h v z   q w u o y  [ ] |
| s r n t k   c d e a i  ; \ |
| x ' b m j   p g , . /      |
+----------------------------+
I'd add a Sym mod to the brackets-equals-hyphen keys.
```

#### Semimak AngleWide-ANSI:
```
+----------------------------+
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 = 7 8 9 0 -    |
|  f l h v z [ q w u o y ; \ |
|  s r n t k ] c d e a i     |
|   ' b m j x / p g , .      |
+----------------------------+
```

The Semimak-JQ layout
---------------------
After a while of testing and getting feedback after the one-month Semimak speed contest, Semi made a little twist and now he uses the [Semimak-JQ][Sem_JQ] mod that he made in September 2021.

It's just a `Q > J > QU` cycle so it's no big change. Although Semi thinks it's "objectively" better and solves some problems with apostrophe n-grams, some of the fastest Semimak typists still prefer the original.

In EPKL you can select Semimak-eD-JQ as a layout variant of Semimak-eD: In the `Layout Selector` GUI, use the `Variant/Locale` setting.

#### Semimak-JQ
```
+----------------------------+
| f l h v z   ' w u o y  [ ] |
| s r n t k   c d e a i  ; \ |
| x j b m q   p g , . /      |
+----------------------------+
Remap cycle from vanilla: Q > J > QU
```
