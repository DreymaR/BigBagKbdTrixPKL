The rock solid QUARTZ Perfect Pangram layout
--------------------------------------------
- This layout is based on a [perfect pangram][WikPan]. Therefore, it is a perfect layout!
- Somehow, I felt it's best used with AngleWide hand positions, as seen on the colored image below.
- It should be perfectly suited for typists who want to write about quartz glyph jobs.
- If you want to horse around instead of rocking hard, try the [Foalmak][LayFoa] layout?
