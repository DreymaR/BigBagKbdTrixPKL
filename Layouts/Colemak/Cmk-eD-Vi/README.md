Colemak[eD] locale layouts
--------------------------
Most of the Cmk-eD locale variants use ISO keyboards with an AngleWide configuration to allow index finger access to the bracket and ISO_102 keys where I mostly put the needed locale letters.

This may be supplemented with Curl(DH) and Sym mods to provide Colemak-CAW(S) with locale letters. You could remove the Wide mod if desired, but then the right hand pinky may get overworked.

Some locales traditionally use ANSI keyboards though, and some prefer to use the AltGr key instead of dead keys. So there may be other variants available.

Colemak-Vi Tiếng Việt (Vietnam) locale layout variant
-----------------------------------------------------
This layout variant aims to provide a Vietnamese Colemak that works well with EPKL and Colemak[eD].
- Special letters are on AltGr(RAlt) plus letters D A W E O I U → đ â ă ê ô ơ ư
- Accents ´`?~. are on bracket keys as well as AltGr plus R S T.
- This layout was designed to work with a standard US-type ANSI system (Windows) layout with RAlt key not predefined as AltGr.
- This type of system layout is typical for US and Vietnamese keyboards. This layout also works on ISO keyboards though!
