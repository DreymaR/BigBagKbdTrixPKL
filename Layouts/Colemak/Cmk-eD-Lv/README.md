Colemak[eD] locale layouts
--------------------------
Most of the Cmk-eD locale variants use ISO keyboards with an AngleWide configuration to allow index finger access to the bracket and ISO_102 keys where I mostly put the needed locale letters.

This may be supplemented with Curl(DH) and Sym mods to provide Colemak-CAW(S) with locale letters. You could remove the Wide mod if desired, but then the right hand pinky may get overworked.

Some locales traditionally use ANSI keyboards though, and some prefer to use the AltGr key instead of dead keys. So there may be other variants available.

Colemak-Lv Latvian locale layout variant
----------------------------------------
For Latvian, the letters `āēīōū` with macron, `čřšž` with háček and `ġķļņŗ` with cedilla may be needed.
- Most keyboards in Latvia are of the ANSI type. Therefore, I've included both ANS and ISO variants.
- There is a special dead key on <kbd>]</kbd>. The layout itself stays the same as standard Colemak-eD.
- To write the special Latvian letters, hit the RBr DK then `aeiou`/`crsz`/`gklnr` to get `āēīōū`/`čřšž`/`ġķļņŗ`.
- To type the right bracket character, type a Space or a left bracket to release it.
- You can also use the Compose key method for the special letters, should you want to.
- Type for instance `ā` as <kbd>A</kbd>-<kbd>Compose</kbd>. Use `-` for macron, `<` for hacek, `,` for cedilla.
