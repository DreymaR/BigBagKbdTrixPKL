;;  Layout Definition file
;;  for EPiKaL Portable Keyboard Layout (EPKL) by Øystein "DreymaR" Bech-Aase (2015-), based on PKL by Máté Farkas (2008-2010).
;
;;  - The Layout.ini file may point to a BaseLayout as well as Extend/DeadKey/Compose/etc table files.
;;  - It can override BaseLayout, EPKL_Layouts_Override and EPKL_Layouts mappings, add key (re)maps and other layout info.
;;  - It can be overridden by a Layout_Override user file located in the same layout folder as itself.
;;  - To select a layout, you can use the Layout/Settings dialog from the EPKL tray menu (or Ctrl+Shift+6).
;;  - Another way is to edit the EPKL_Layouts(_Override) 'layout = ' line and/or Type/Mod/ID/etc entries.
;;  - Alternatively, run EPKL in compactMode with the layout's files directly inside the main program folder.
