;;  Layout Definition file
;;  for EPiKaL Portable Keyboard Layout (EPKL) by Øystein "DreymaR" Bech-Aase (2015-), based on PKL by Máté Farkas (2008-2010).
;
;;  - The Layout.ini file may point to a BaseLayout as well as Extend/DeadKey/Compose/etc table files.
;;  - It can override BaseLayout, EPKL_Layouts_Override and EPKL_Layouts mappings, add key (re)maps and other layout info.
;;  - It, in turn, can be overridden by a Layout_Override user file located in the same layout folder as itself.
;;  - To select a layout, you can use the Layout/Settings dialog from the EPKL tray menu (or Ctrl+Shift+6).
;;  - A more low-level way is to edit the EPKL_Layouts(_Override) 'layout = ' line and/or Type/Mod/ID/etc entries directly.
;;  - Alternatively, run EPKL in compactMode with the layout's files directly inside the main program folder.
;;  ================================================================================================================================================
;
;;  Base Layout file info:
;;  - This file defines a useable layout in the EPKL format.
;;  - It is pointed to and overridden by Layout.ini files for key remaps, mapping overrides etc.
;;  - Any BaseLayout file may in turn point to and override another, in a BaseStack.
