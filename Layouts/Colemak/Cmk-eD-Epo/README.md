Colemak[eD] locale layouts
--------------------------
Most of the Cmk-eD locale variants use ISO keyboards with an AngleWide configuration to allow index finger access to the bracket and ISO_102 keys where I mostly put the needed locale letters.

This may be supplemented with Curl(DH) and Sym mods to provide Colemak-CAW(S) with locale letters. You could remove the Wide mod if desired, but then the right hand pinky may get overworked.

Some locales traditionally use ANSI keyboards though, and some prefer to use the AltGr key instead of dead keys. So there may be other variants available.

Colemak-Epo Esperanto "locale" layout variant
---------------------------------------------
For Esperanto, the letters `ĉĝĥĵŝ` with circumflex and `ŭ` with brevis are needed.
- Instead of dead keys this variant uses Compose. The layout itself stays the same as standard Colemak-eD.
- To write the special Esperanto letters, you can either use the standard dead keys (AltGr+6/9)...
-   ...or just type one of `cghjsu` then Compose to get `ĉĝĥĵŝŭ`.
- On ANSI boards, there isn't that nice ISO key for the Compose key but...
-   ...in Esperanto the <kbd>x</kbd> key is often used for accents. So we put Compose there!
- To type `x`, use <kbd>AltGr</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> or <kbd>k</kbd><kbd>x</kbd> (since `x` in a way is `ks`).
