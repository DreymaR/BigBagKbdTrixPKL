The Colemak layout
------------------
- The [Colemak keyboard layout][CmkCom] was designed by Shai Coleman in 2006.
- It's my main layout, and highly recommended if you're considering which layout to switch to!
- You really should read more about it on its [main site][CmkCom] and/or [other sites][CmkOrg].
- With EPKL, you can get Cmk with several [ergonomic mods][BB_Erg] and [locale variants][BB_Loc].

Ergonomic mods
--------------
- There are several ergonomic mods available such as [Colemak-DH (CurlAngle)][BB_CDH].
    - NOTE: You should use an Angle mod with Curl(DH) for traditional row-staggered boards.
    - Make sure you read and understand the relevant parts of the BigBag Ergonomy page.
    - For Ortho/matrix boards (ISO-Orth and ANS-Orth) there are non-Angle versions available.

Colemak[eD]: Colemak - edition DreymaR
--------------------------------------
- Unless you use a simple VK type layout that keeps all keys as in your Windows layout...
- EPKL will usually provide you with [Colemak-eD mappings for AltGr and dead key layers][BB_CeD].
