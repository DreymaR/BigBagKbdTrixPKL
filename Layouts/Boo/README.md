The Boo layout
--------------
- This is a hand-made layout by Discord user Boo. It fares well even in modern analysis.
- It contains its own Symbol mod by default, including the good hyphen placement of Dvorak.
- For more info, see the [Boo Layout Page at github.io][BooLay].

Similarity to Dvorak
--------------------
- The Boo layout has several similarities to Dvorak, such as the `AOE;`, `BT` and symbol key positions.
- Also, 9 keys are moved only a short distance from their Dvorak positions as seen below.
- It still has much better stats due to observation of modern design philosophies.
- Therefore, it may be a good choice for experienced Dvorak users who want a better layout?!
- Note that it has U on the same finger as E to reduce same-finger bigrams (SFB).
- It also avoids placing I on the index finger like Dvorak has, for the same reason.
- As a result of the UE improvement, <kbd>,</kbd> <kbd>.</kbd> move one key to the left.
- The LS and RN SFBs are avoided by the `L > R > N > H` remap.
- Dvorak's poor <kbd>F</kbd> position is fixed by a simple move, much like in [DreymaR's Dvorak-Curl-ID mod][Dvk-ID].

In case you're interested, here are the three transition loops from Dvorak to Boo:
```
H > M > W > K > V > Y > L > R > N
. > , > ' > J > Z > X > Q > F > G > I > S > U
P > B > D > C
```
Armed with this knowledge, one could make a set of transitional "TarBoo" layouts in analogy to the Tarmak layouts:
```
1) H > M > W > K
2) H > M > W > K > V > Y > L > R > N
3) U > . > , > ' > J > Z
4) U > . > , > ' > J > Z > X > Q > F > G > I > S
5) P > B > D > C
```
In the above, <kbd>K</kbd> is [the rarest key][SymMod] in the first loop and <kbd>Z</kbd> in the second loop.
