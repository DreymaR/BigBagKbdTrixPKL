NOTE: The full set of deadkey images is a bit bandwidth heavy when copied to all layouts.
Therefore, to use another layout with these dead key help images please copy them over from the Colemak-eD\Cmk-eD_ISO dir to your layout dir.
Using PKL_eD you could instead specify the directory here as dk_imgDir in the [eD_info] section of your layout.ini file.
I currently use 19 dead keys (with both shifted and unshifted .png images).

Unfortunately, I haven't found time to make images that reflect the choice of Wide/Angle mods, locale variants etc. I need to script Inkscape.

My goal is to make the background separate from the letters/symbols. That way, the images will take less space and you can choose backgrounds.
