; The layout ini file is "layouts/[key value]/layout.ini"
; You can use multiple layouts and give them human-readable names like this:
;     layout = LayoutFolder1:DisplayedName1,LayoutFolder2:DisplayedName2
; Remove the ';' in front of 'layout = ' on one line only below - or make your own!

;  Tarmak learning setup: Gradually switch from VirtualKey QWERTY to Colemak-CurlAngleWide
;  The standard Tarmak steps are Tarmak0QWERTY, Tarmak1E, Tarmak2ET, Tarmak3ETR, Tarmak4ETRO and Tarmak5Colemak
;layout = vk_TarmakCurl1E_AWing:Tarmak1,vk_Tarmak0QWERTY_AWing:QWERTY(VK)

;  Colemak[edition DreymaR]; switch to 'VirtualKey' QWERTY
;  NOTE: Currently, there isn't an out-of-the-box AngleWing Colemak[eD] as it'd be too much to maintain. Ask DreymaR if you need one.
;

;  Start with 'VirtualKey' Colemak; switch to 'VirtualKey' QWERTY (or vice versa)
;layout = vk_TarmakCurl5Cmk_AWing:Colemak(VK)-CAWing,vk_Tarmak0QWERTY_AWing:QWERTY(VK)-AWing

; The original mode for non-ASCII characters may not work with 
; all programs (for example GTK applications, like Klavaro or Pidgin)
; so you can try alternative modes with this hotkey.
; If you have found the best mode, you can write it into the 
; nonASCII.ini; and please send it to me as well!

; If your original layout has deadkeys, put them here.
;   (For instance, on the Hungarian keyboard '^' is a dead key, 
;    so if I would like to type a '^', I must type '^' then 'Space'.)
; If you write "auto", PKL will hopefully use the correct mode (if someone sent it to FMate)
systemsDeadkeys = auto
;systemsDeadkeys = `´¨^~

; A file name in the Languages folder (without .ini). If it is 'auto',

; Compact mode: every external file is in the same folder as pkl.exe
compactMode = no

; Windows internally translates the AltGr (right Alt) key to LEFT Ctrl + RIGHT Alt
; If you enable this option, PKL detect AltGr as (one of) Ctrl + (one of) Alt.
; (this is useful for notebook keyboards that do not have a right alt or AltGr key.)
; It is not recommended, because fortunately many programs know the
; difference between AltGr and Alt+Ctrl
altGrEqualsAltCtrl = no

; If you often forget to exit PKL at a shared computer, you can set a suspend timeout
; in minutes: After this time of inactivity (no keypresses) PKL will suspend itself.
; The exit timeout is similar: after this time is spent suspended PKL will shut down.
; For example if you use suspend=5, exit=30, then after 5 minutes of 
; inactivity PKL suspends; if you are there, you can go live again. If you 
; forgot to disable PKL and left, after 5 minutes your friend would not find it out.
; After 30 minutes in suspension, PKL would then exit.
; You can disable these features by setting the timeouts to 0.
; Important: only "coming out from suspend" counts as an activity for exitTimeOut, 
; so if you write 0 to suspend and 30 to exit, it will exit after 30 
; minutes, even if you type or press other keys.
suspendTimeOut = 0
exitTimeOut = 0

; If it is yes/true/1, pkl will start up suspended.
; (Yes, I know the helper image is appearing and hiding.)
; I think it's better to start PKL when you need it instead.

; NOTES:
; - This map shows Colemak on an ISO board (with VK_102).
;    * The remaps should be by scan codes though, so the positions are layout independent!
;    * Since PKL currently doesn't remap scan codes, the Extend must be remapped instead.
;    * For now, select between different [extend] sections below by renaming the sections.
; - Multiple extended mappings would've been nice; this setup is a general/basic one.
;    * For instance, accelerated nav/mousing, NumPad/maths, mirroring, coder's toolbox...
; - If your layout doesn't define the key, 'extend' won't work with it!
;    * Solution: Put, e.g., 'SC039 = SPACE	VirtualKey' etc in your layout .ini file.
;    * You'll need at least Escape/Space/Return/Back and F1-F12 for full functionality.
; - The Tab key is currently a poor candidate for remapping because of problems with AltTab.
;    * It might be useable as another extensor/modifier though? (Probably best left alone.)
; - A WARS = modifier block idea didn't work because R couldn't map a modifier! A bug?!
;    * (I believe the hardware scan matrix had CapsLock on the same column as the R key...)
;    * R can map non-modifiers, so I settled for another solution for now: The mouse wheel.
;    * My preferred way would have browsing/modifiers more ergonomically/logically placed:
;+------+------+------+------+------+
;|Tab   |Q €€€ |W <<> |F <>> |P *** |
;|      | Esc  | BrBck| BrFwd| *WhUp|
;+------+------+------+------+------+
;|Caps+ |A +++ |R +++ |S +++ |T *** |
;| ++++ | Alt  | Ctrl | Shift| *WhDn|
;+------+------+------+------+------+
; - A Win key proved hard to implement, but many Win hotkeys use letters/nums anyway.
;    * It'd be useful for Win-arrows, Win-F1/F3, Win-Break, the Start menu...
;    * Tip: T+Q (Ctrl-Esc) shows the Start menu. Win-Help/Win-Search are on that menu.
; - Tech note: The mappings are on the form Send {Blind}{%YourMapping%} (see the AHK Help).
;    * Thus, if you want, say, a modified keypress you can use, e.g., '}#r{' or '}^{Left'.
; - There isn't a sendable Undo key per se, oddly enough (but Ctrl+Z does the trick).
;    * However, A+O (Alt-Back) = Undo (http://www.geocities.com/ian_springer/winkey.html).
; - Actually, it'd be nice to be able to Send any APPCOMMAND_ message, but AHK can't.
;    * APPCOMMAND candidates: UNDO/REDO, NEW/OPEN/CLOSE, PRINT...
; - The Ctrl+ZXCV commands could be mapped with }!{Backspace, }+{Del, }^{Ins & }+{Ins
;    * However, from Win7 there's a problem with this Cut command in some settings.
; - Mapping something to the Sleep or Power key doesn't seem to do a lot on most computers?
; - The Pause and CtrlBreak are usually both on the same physical key, which is a bit weird.
;    * Using Pause, Win+Enter is System Properties.
;    * Actually, both Pause/Break and SysRq/PrntScrn send their codes strangely.
;    * Hence, I didn't remap any of them to avoid trouble.
; - The AppsKey and Btn2 may seem to do the same, but the menu appears in different places.
; - Mapping Del, Back or something else to the ` (Tilde) key was a bit of a toss-up.
;    * For instance, use S+` (Shift-Del) to delete a file bypassing the Recycle Bin.
;    * Other candidates: ^}w{ (Close), ^}a{ (Select All), ^}t{ (New Tab), #}t{ (Taskbar)...

; TIPS:
; - These mappings enable you to do many things without leaving the typing home position.
;    * Mappings are based on ease of reach vs. usefulness, and some left-hand-only use.
; - This could take some getting used to for the left pinky, but it gets really cool!!!
; - Caps+Esc turns the CapsLock state on and off now.
; - It's handy to control your browser back/forward with the left hand only while browsing.
; - Space for Enter is also nice; can be worked with left-hand-only as well.
;    * To press dialogue buttons for instance, use Tab to move and Space/Q to select/abort.
;    * A+Space (=Alt+Enter) when a file/disk is selected, brings up the object's Properties.
; - Use Apps (or *Btn2) for context menus; arrows, 'mousing' or shortcuts select items.
; - Esc mapped to '[' (Telnet/Vim/etc compliant) is okay, but a left-hand one is also great.
; - Using S/T (Shift/cTrl) with the UNEI/LY/O' keys you can jump words, jump/select, etc.
; - The number keys are mapped to function keys. They are reachable with the left hand!
;    * A4 closes apps; Win+3 GUI-searches; try 1(Help)/2(Rename)/3(Find)/5(Refresh) too.
; - The function keys are mapped to multimedia keys like the ones on multimedia keyboards.
;    * Browser_Stop/Refresh/Search are usually covered by hotkeys (e.g., Esc/F5/^F).
;    * Browser_Favorites usually needs a menu choice, so that's included (near the arrows).
; - The App1/2 keys are defined in the registry, in ShellExecute (REG_SZ) values:
;    * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\AppKey\17
;    * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\AppKey\18
;    * You could also do user-specific ones in HKEY_CURRENT_USER (might have to create them).
;    * Usually though, I find that the defaults of Explorer (App1) and Calc (App2) are fine.
;    * The Mail one lies in AppKey\15, Media in 16, and Browser in 7. These too are editable.
; - Wheel Up/Dn are nice for scrolling windows/bars; Wheel Left/Right for horizontal scroll.
;    * Horizontal scrolling doesn't always work though.
; - The 'virtual mousing' is rudimentary; a 'last resort' when arrows/Tab aren't enough.
;    * I find it useful for moving the pointer out of the way and regaining window focus.
;    * A mousing resolution of 17 pixels roughly fits *most* context and similiar menus.
;    * A full mouse layout could have multi-resolution, diagonals, Btn4/Btn5 and sticky Btn1.
;    * The keyboard's auto-repeat makes virtual mousing odd/'laggy' when a key is held down.
;    * In particular, beware of holding down the *Btn key(s) for a 'rapid-click' effect.
